    "# Unpacking Hugging Face Transformers: Your LLM Factory Kit\n",
    "\n",
    "The world of Large Language Models (LLMs) can feel complex and arcane at first.  \n",
    "You may already understand the core idea: **Transformer blocks** process text using self-attention and feed-forward networks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then you hear *“Hugging Face Transformers”*, and suddenly it feels like *transformers are managing other transformers*.  \n",
    "That’s where the confusion starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s clear that up with a **simple and accurate analogy**: **The Factory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Factory Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the difference between **the model architecture** and **the Hugging Face library**, think of it this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 The Transformer Block — *The Blueprint*\n",
    "This is the fundamental mathematical unit:\n",
    "- Self-attention  \n",
    "- Feed-forward network  \n",
    "- Residual connections  \n",
    "- Layer normalization  \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s pure math and neural network design:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \\text{Softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 An LLM — *The Vehicle*\n",
    "An LLM (like **GPT-2**, **BERT**, or **LLaMA**) is a **complete machine**:\n",
    "- Built by stacking many Transformer blocks\n",
    "- Wired with embeddings and output heads\n",
    "- Trained with billions of parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **actual model** that runs on GPUs and produces text.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Hugging Face Transformers — *The Factory*\n",
    "Hugging Face Transformers is **not a model**.  \n",
    "It is a **Python library** that acts like a professional factory:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It stores **blueprints**\n",
    "- Runs the **assembly line**\n",
    "- Loads **pre-trained engines**\n",
    "- Provides tools to **train, test, and deploy**\n",
    "\n",
    "It does **not change the math** of Transformers.  \n",
    "It simply manages them.\n",

    "- `GPT2Block`\n",
    "- `BertLayer`\n",
    "- `LlamaDecoderLayer`\n",

    "You **do not** need to re-implement attention equations or tensor plumbing.  \n",
    "The factory already has the molds.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ The Assembly Line — Model Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "When you instantiate a model class like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(\"gpt2\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The factory performs these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Builds embeddings  \n",
    "2. Stacks Transformer blocks  \n",
    "3. Attaches a language-modeling head  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, you get a **fully functional PyTorch model**.\n",
